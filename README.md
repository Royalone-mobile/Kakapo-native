This repo differs from the others as it is built using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and has some limitations due to rules/hardware/software so it is a somewhat slimmed down version although being a native app it also has some nice advantages.

- Still achieves the same look and design.
- Performance is very smooth and it also works offline.
- Integrates JavaScript, Objective C & Swift.
- Still able to use [Reflux](https://github.com/reflux/refluxjs) and store/fetch the data with promises.
- Deployment to the app store is very easy.
